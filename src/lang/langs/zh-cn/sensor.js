        "此应用程序是一个IoT设备。 传感器设备能测量倾斜角度并将信号发送到网关。 此机制能向服务器提供实时反馈。 通过GIS平台，监控办公室能识别具有地理位置、树木属性和其倾斜角度的个别树木。大规模的树木藉此能同时监测。通过能评估树木健康，快速且可靠的附加信息，这能促进树木管理团队的工作。",

      "We base on Smart Sensing Technology (SST) to develop an integrated system for monitoring tree tilting angles. With tailor-made sensors installed on the lower trunk of 400 selected urban trees in two areas with high traffic and pedestrian flow, it monitors tree tilting angles over time. Trees of 9 vulnerable species at risk of tree failure are selected for monitoring, such as Bauhinia variegata, Delonix regia, Senna siamea, Aleurites moluccana, etc.",
    p2:
      "Taking various environmental factors into consideration, a threshold value will be determined to measure the root-plate movement. If a sensor detects that the tilting angle of a tree exceeds the threshold, the System will give an alert to conduct a visit to the tree and/or to conduct detailed investigations. The System will be further implemented on over 8,000 trees across the entire city in Hong Kong.",
    p3:
      "The sensor measures the mechanical response of a tree to wind force, recording the tilting values at near ground level and provides an insightful strength of root anchorage. Monitoring root plate rotation by means of the sensor on a regular basis would enable an early warning system in tree management to reduce the risk of damage caused by root failure."
