        "This sensor is an IoT device. It can measure tilting angles and send the signals to the gateway. This mechanism can provide an instant feedback to the server. Through the GIS platform, an individual tree with geographical location, tree attributes and its tilt angle can be identified on the screen of a computer located in the monitoring office. A massive scale of trees can be monitored at the same instant. This operation could facilitate the works of tree management team by providing fast and reliable additional information for assessing tree health.",
      p2:
        "We hope that the early notification of tree risk would eventually benefit to the public in this way to preserve trees in Hong Kong to the further extent."

    p1:
      "We base on Smart Sensing Technology (SST) to develop an integrated system for monitoring tree tilting angles. With tailor-made sensors installed on the lower trunk of 400 selected urban trees in two areas with high traffic and pedestrian flow, it monitors tree tilting angles over time. Many varieties of urban trees of common species are selected for monitoring, e.g. Bauhinia variegata, Delonix regia, Senna siamea, Aleurites moluccana. ",
    p2:
      "Taking various environmental factors into consideration, a threshold value will be determined to measure the root-plate movement. If a sensor detects that the tilting angle of a tree exceeds the threshold, the System will give an alert to conduct a visit to the tree and/or to conduct detailed investigations. The System will be further implemented on over 8,000 trees across the entire city in Hong Kong.",
    p3:
      "The sensor measures the mechanical response of a tree to wind force, recording the tilting values at near ground level and provides an insightful strength of root anchorage. Monitoring root plate rotation by means of the sensor on a regular basis would enable an early warning system in tree management to reduce the risk of damage caused by root failure."
