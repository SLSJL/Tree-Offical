        "傳感器用於測量傾斜角度，實時將資訊發送至中轉機站，再由機站傳遞資訊到服務器，組成物聯網 (IoT)。 通過地理資訊系統 (GIS)，個別樹木的地理坐標可以顯示樹木的位置、特徵以及傾斜角度等重要資訊， 並可大規模監測遍佈於全香港不同位置的城市樹木。這個運作提供快速且可靠的額外資料，促進樹木管理團隊評估樹木狀況。",

        "我們期望樹木監測系統將來可提供早期樹木通知，從而保育香港城市樹木，惠及普羅市民大眾。"

      "We base on Smart Sensing Technology (SST) to develop an integrated system for monitoring tree tilting angles. With tailor-made sensors installed on the lower trunk of 400 selected urban trees in two areas with high traffic and pedestrian flow, it monitors tree tilting angles over time. Trees of 9 vulnerable species at risk of tree failure are selected for monitoring, such as Bauhinia variegata, Delonix regia, Senna siamea, Aleurites moluccana, etc.",
    p2:
      "Taking various environmental factors into consideration, a threshold value will be determined to measure the root-plate movement. If a sensor detects that the tilting angle of a tree exceeds the threshold, the System will give an alert to conduct a visit to the tree and/or to conduct detailed investigations. The System will be further implemented on over 8,000 trees across the entire city in Hong Kong.",
    p3:
      "The sensor measures the mechanical response of a tree to wind force, recording the tilting values at near ground level and provides an insightful strength of root anchorage. Monitoring root plate rotation by means of the sensor on a regular basis would enable an early warning system in tree management to reduce the risk of damage caused by root failure."
