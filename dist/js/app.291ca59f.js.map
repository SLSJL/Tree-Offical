Weak anchorage in the root system which may cause hazard of tree falling can be detected by measuring the turning momentum or capturing tilting data of a tree. The weaving interaction between wind and a tree is dynamic and depends on the inherent vibrating frequency of a tree. The wind force on tree canopy generates a turning momentum at the tree base. Such a turning momentum is resisted by the root system and it can be considered as a function of the rotational angle of the structural root zone. If the root system is not strong enough to sustain the turning momentum, the tree will tilt or be uprooted and then will fall.
